heart with rotten wood and it decayed from the start","Cause you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along","No, you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along","I braved treacherous streets and kids strung out on homemade speed","And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all","Cause at night the sun in retreat made the skyline look like crooked teeth in the mouth of a man who was devouring us both","You're so cute when you're slurring your speech","But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave","And you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along","No, you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along","I'm a war of head versus heart and it's always this way","My head is weak and my heart always speaks before I know what it will say","And you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along","No, you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all

there's no comfort in the waiting room","Just nervous paces bracing for bad news","And then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head","But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:","That love is
